# mongov

Mongov is a very simple data viewer for [MongoDB](http://mongodb.org) built with [Sinatra](http://www.sinatrarb.com) and [Twitter's Bootstrap library](http://twitter.github.com/bootstrap).

## Installation

`sudo gem install mongov`

Then just run `mongov` to start the server and open `http://localhost:3030/`. Make sure `mongod` is running.

## Configuration

None yet. Mongov assumes you're running MongoDB locally with the standard configuration. You're welcome to submit a patch to add configs.
